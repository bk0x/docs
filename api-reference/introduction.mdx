ScrapeDev is a powerful tool designed to simplify web data extraction by avoiding detection systems typically used by websites to block automated scraping. Using cutting-edge technology, such as rotating proxies, customizable headless browsers, and advanced CAPTCHA-solving techniques, ScrapeDev ensures that your scraping process goes undetected, allowing you to gather data efficiently without interruptions.


## Token

A unique token is created for each user who registers on our site. In order to make API calls, you must specify your own token in the URL with the "token" parameter.

## URL

In ScrapeDev, ensuring that the URLs you provide are correctly formatted is crucial for successful data extraction. Each URL submitted through our API must begin with either "http://" or "https://", as this specifies the protocol used to access the target website. This protocol validation is essential to make sure your requests are correctly routed and processed.
